						The series revolves mainly around four schoolboys; Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick, but in later years it has introduced a number of other characters. The show has also caused a number of controversies regarding its content, as well as the parodies of people and events it portrays.

						Along with The Simpsons and Arthur, South Park is the third longest-running cartoon in America.</p>
